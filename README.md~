# Introduction
=====================================

This project is a collection of Java implementations of various data structures and algorithms, and most concepts in java like object, class, interface, etc. It aims to provide a comprehensive resource for learning and practicing Java programming.

# Downloading and Setting Up the Source
-----------------------------------------

To download the source code, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using Git: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git`
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, etc.)
3. Make sure you have Java 8 or later installed on your system

# Features Implemented in Java
-------------------------------

### Data Structures

* **ArrayList**: A resizable array implementation of the List interface
* **LinkedList**: A doubly-linked list implementation of the List interface
* **HashSet**: A set implementation using a hash table (updating soon)
* **TreeSet**: A set implementation using a Red-Black tree (updating soon)

### Algorithms (updating soon)

* **Sorting**: Implementations of various sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, etc.)
* **Searching**: Implementations of various searching algorithms (Linear Search, Binary Search, etc.)

### Other Features
* **Java basics**:Concepts, syntax,Operators, Object-oriented programming, inheritance, polymorphism, etc.
* **String Manipulation**: Methods for string concatenation, substring extraction, and more
* **File Input/Output**: Methods for reading and writing files in Java

### Collections Framework

* **List**: An ordered collection that allows duplicate elements
* **Set**: An unordered collection that does not allow duplicate elements
* **Map**: A collection that stores key-value pairs

### Streams API (updating soon)

* **Stream Operations**: Methods for filtering, mapping, and reducing streams

Note: something has not done yet. (update soon)
