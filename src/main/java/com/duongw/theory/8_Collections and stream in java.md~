### Collections

- In java, collections are a group of object that are stored multiple elements.
- Collections framework in Java is part of the JFC (Java Foundation Classes) library, which provides a set of interfaces
  and classes that define the behavior of collections.

1) List
   A list is an ordered collection that allows duplicate elements. Common implementations include ArrayList, LinkedList,
   and Vector.

2) Set
   A set is an unordered collection that does not allow duplicate elements. Common implementations include HashSet,
   TreeSet, and LinkedHashSet.

3) Map
   A map is a collection that stores key-value pairs. Each key must be unique, but the value can be duplicated. Common
   implementations include HashMap, TreeMap, and LinkedHashMap.

4) Queue:
   A queue is a collection used to hold elements before processing. Common
   implementations include LinkedList (which can acts as bot the list and queue) and PriorityQueue.
